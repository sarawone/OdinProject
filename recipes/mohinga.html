        <li>Thickener: Toasted rice flour or gram (chickpea) flour.</li>
        <li>Flavorings: Fish sauce, shrimp paste, and sometimes chilli powder/paprika.</li>
        <li>Texture: Sliced banana stem (or lotus root).</li>
        <li>Noodles: Thin rice vermicelli.</li>
        <li>Hard-boiled eggs</li>
        <li>Crispy fried onions or garlic</li>
        <li>Crispy chana dal crackers or fritters</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander</li>
        <li>Lime wedges</li>
        <li>Dried chilli flakes or oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps Instructions</h1>
    <h3>1. Prepare The Fish & Broth</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the fish: In a large pot, combine the fish with 3 smashed lemongrass stalks, 1 tsp turmeric, 2 tbsp fish sauce, and 6 cups of water. Boil for 15–20 minutes until the fish is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Debone: Remove the fish and let it cool. Carefully flake the flesh, ensuring all bones are removed. </li>
        <li>Save the Stock: Strain the liquid, keeping the broth. Set both the fish and stock aside.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>2. Prepare the Flavor Base (Aromatics)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make Paste: Pound or blend the ginger, garlic, shallots, and the inner white parts of the remaining lemongrass into a fine paste.</li>
        <li>Fry Paste: Heat 3-4 tbsp of oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the pounded paste, paprika, and turmeric. Fry for 5–7 minutes until fragrant and the oil separates. </li>
        <li>Add Fish: Add the flaked fish to the paste mixture and stir-fry for another 5 minutes to infuse the flavor.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>3. Assemble and Simmer the Soup</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine: Pour the reserved fish stock back into the pot with the fish and paste mixture.</li>
        <li>Thicken: In a small bowl, mix the toasted rice powder and chickpea flour with a little cold water to make a smooth slurry. Stir this into the soup to avoid clumping. </li>
        <li>Simmer: Add banana stem (if using) and extra fish sauce/salt to taste. Simmer for 15–30 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>4.Prepare Noodles and Serving </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Noodles: Soak dried rice vermicelli in hot water for 10–15 minutes until soft, then drain.</li>
        <li>Serve: Place a portion of noodles in a bowl, ladle the hot soup over them, and garnish with sliced boiled eggs, coriander, lime, fried shallots, and chili</li>
    </ol>
